# PatientHelpline
Problem Statement:
* In our current healthcare system there is no way of knowing that the doctor you trust and want to get treated by, is available at hospital or not.
* Checking the availability of blood at blood banks, beds at hospital is a very long process for any common man.
* In case of emergency unavailability of proper treatment or some resources can cost a life.
* Doctors for animals are very less in number and are mostly situated at remote areas , resulting in unawareness among pet keepers of their availability.
* On time treatment for stray dogs is unavailable .

Solution:   <b>PatientHelpline  </b>
